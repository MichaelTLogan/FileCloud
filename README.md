The purpose of this project is to serve as my own personal video file storage cloud. I intended to add video editting functionality as well but ran out of time after my laptop got stolen.

I'll be honest, I don't feel good about this project because it doesn't match my end vision at all. To me it feels too incomplete but at least the essential functionality is there. I struggled with learning React and AWS Amplify. I am not very good with back-end stuff. If I could go back and restart this project, I would see if I can find a way to do it in a language that I wouldn't have had to learn from scratch.

Even though right now this is an assignment for a class, it is something I genuinely have some passion for. I intend to take what I've learned from this and turn it into a fully functional and intuitive app which serves the same purpose. Some updates to this project were lost because I forgot to push them. Oh well.
